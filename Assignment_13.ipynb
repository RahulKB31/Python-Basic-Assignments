    "Excel spreadsheets and CSV (Comma-Separated Values) spreadsheets each have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on your specific use case and requirements. Here are some advantages of Excel spreadsheets over CSV spreadsheets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rich Formatting and Styling**: Excel supports a wide range of formatting options, including fonts, colors, cell borders, and cell merging. You can apply different styles to cells, rows, and columns, which makes it suitable for creating visually appealing reports and data presentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Formulas and Functions**: Excel provides a robust set of built-in formulas and functions for performing calculations and data analysis. Users can easily create complex formulas and perform calculations directly within the spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Charts and Graphs**: Excel allows users to create a variety of charts and graphs to visualize data. You can generate bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and more to present data in a visual format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Validation**: Excel offers data validation features to control and restrict the type of data that can be entered into cells. This helps ensure data accuracy and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cell Comments and Notes**: Excel allows users to add comments and notes to cells for providing additional context or explanations about the data, which can be valuable for collaboration and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Filtering and Sorting**: Excel provides easy-to-use tools for filtering and sorting data, making it simpler to analyze and explore large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Multiple Worksheets**: Excel workbooks can contain multiple worksheets, which is useful for organizing and structuring data into different sections or categories within a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Password Protection**: Excel allows you to password-protect the entire workbook or individual sheets, providing security for sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Data Forms**: Excel includes data forms that can simplify data entry, especially for tabular data with many columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Advanced Features**: Excel supports advanced features like pivot tables, data tables, and macros, which are powerful for data analysis, modeling, and automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Integration with Other Office Applications**: Excel seamlessly integrates with other Microsoft Office applications, such as Word and PowerPoint, allowing you to embed and link data easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Excel offers these advantages, it's important to note that CSV has its own strengths, such as simplicity, platform independence, and ease of integration with various software and programming languages. The choice between Excel and CSV depends on factors like data complexity, intended use, collaboration requirements, and data interchange needs."

    "\n",
    "1. **`csv.reader()`**: To create a reader object, you pass a file-like object that you want to read from. This can be a file object (opened in text or binary mode) or any object that implements the file-like interface, such as a StringIO object. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import csv\n",
