Instead, you provide the PDF file's path to these classes, and they handle the file access internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you typically use `PdfFileReader()` and `PdfFileWriter()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PdfFileReader() - Reading a PDF**:\n",

    "   from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **PdfFileWriter() - Writing to a PDF**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You don't need to explicitly open the output PDF file for writing. Instead, `PdfFileWriter()` creates an in-memory representation of a PDF file that you can add content to. You can later write this content to a new file using `pdf_writer.write()`.\n",

Here are the key differences between a \"Run\" object and a \"Paragraph\" object:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Paragraph Object**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Role**: A Paragraph object represents a single paragraph of text within a document. It is used to group and format text that logically belongs together within a single paragraph.\n",
    "   - **Content**: A Paragraph can contain multiple Runs. It typically includes text along with various formatting properties (e.g., font size, style, alignment).\n",
    "   - **Formatting**: Paragraphs can have their own paragraph-level formatting, such as alignment (left, right, center, justified), indentation, and spacing (before and after the paragraph).\n",
    "   - **Usage**: Paragraphs are commonly used for structuring and organizing text into coherent sections, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run Object**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Role**: A Run object represents a contiguous run of text with consistent formatting within a Paragraph. It is used to apply formatting to a specific part of the text within a paragraph.\n",
    "   - **Content**: A Run contains a portion of the text within a Paragraph and applies specific character-level formatting to that portion (e.g., bold, italic, underline).\n",
    "   - **Formatting**: Runs can have their own character-level formatting, such as font style, size, color, and emphasis (bold, italic, underline).\n",
    "   - **Usage**: Runs are used when you need to apply different formatting styles to different parts of a paragraph. For example, you can have a single paragraph that contains both regular and bold text, and you achieve this by using different Runs within the same Paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a \"Paragraph\" object represents a container for logically related text content, while a \"Run\" object represents a contiguous portion of text within a Paragraph with consistent character-level formatting.
